# Task 1 
In concise, clear, and commented Python code, obtain using the OpenAlex API (https://docs.openalex.org) the most recent 100 articles from two academic journals - the American Economic Review and the American Political Science Review including title and the abstract or inverted index of the abstract. 
Create a database of the titles and abstracts and treat the journals as a binary (0/1) label for "economics" = 0 or "political science" = 1. 
Then create a simple classification based on the 1, 2, and 3 word n-grams (i.e., 1-, 2-, and 3- word phrases) and predict which articles are economics or political science.

# Task 2 
In concise, clear, and commented Python code, get the SciBERT LLM up and running and set up to do question-answering. Pose the question: "What is the evidence for community policing?" and send the result.
